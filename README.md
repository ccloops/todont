# TO DO OR TO DONT
### Author:

### Motivation

In this project, I built a React frontend Todo List application. This app uses local storage for persistance. 

In this application, I configured webpack to compile JavaScript and SASS into a bundle and configured babel to transpile JSX and ES6 to ES5 JavaScript. I was able to create and render React components to the DOM, add event listeners to React components, and update React component state.

### Limitations

To use this app - it is assumed that the user has familiarity with the tech and frameworks listed below.

### Code Style

Standard JavaScript with ES6, SASS, CSS, HTML, React!

### How to use?

* Step 1. Fork and Clone the Repository.
* Step 2. `npm install`
* Step 3. `npm run watch` - the application should automatically open in your browser.
* Step 4. Use the input field to enter list items. Click enter or the button to add it to your list.
